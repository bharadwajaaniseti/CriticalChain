# Critical Chain - Complete Refactor Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document contains all the files and database setup needed for the new multi-page glassmorphic design.

## File Structure Changes

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage.ts ✅ Created
│   ├── GamePage.ts ✅ Created
│   └── UpgradePage.ts ✅ Created
├── systems/
│   ├── NavigationManager.ts ✅ Created
│   ├── SkillTreeManager.ts ⚠️ Needs recreation
│   ├── GameStateManager.ts ⚠️ Needs click system
│   └── ... (existing files)
├── styles/
│   └── glassmorphism.css 🆕 Need to create
└── index.ts ⚠️ Needs major update
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Update index.ts to use new page system
### 2. Create new SkillTreeManager with progressive tree
### 3. Implement glassmorphism CSS theme
### 4. Add click regeneration system
### 5. Create Supabase migration files
### 6. Update HTML structure

Would you like me to:
A) Continue creating files one by one (will take multiple messages)
B) Create a complete implementation in a new branch/folder
C) Focus on one specific part first (e.g., just the styling, or just the skill tree)

Which approach would you prefer?
