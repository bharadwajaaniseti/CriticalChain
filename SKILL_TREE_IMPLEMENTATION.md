# Skill Tree Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Skill Tree JSON Definition** (`assets/data/skilltree.json`)
- ✅ 33 balanced upgrade nodes created
- ✅ 4 main progression paths (Neutron, Atom, Chain, Resource)
- ✅ 4 ultimate mastery upgrades
- ✅ Cost scaling from 10 to 15,000 coins
- ✅ Cost multipliers (1.0 - 1.7x) for multi-level upgrades

### 2. **SkillTreeManager System** (`src/systems/SkillTreeManager.ts`)
- ✅ Loads skill tree from JSON file
- ✅ Tracks current level and unlock status
- ✅ Calculates upgrade costs with exponential scaling
- ✅ Handles parent-child unlock relationships
- ✅ Applies upgrade effects to game state
- ✅ Save/restore skill tree state
- ✅ Reset functionality for fresh runs

### 3. **Game State Integration** (`src/systems/GameStateManager.ts`)
- ✅ All upgrade properties exist in GameState
- ✅ Skills modify game state when purchased
- ✅ Fresh run resets skill tree
- ✅ Prestige system preserves permanent upgrades

### 4. **Upgrade Effects Applied**
All 33 upgrades now directly modify game behavior:

#### Neutron Upgrades (10 nodes)
- `neutronCountPlayer`: 2 → up to 8 (+6 from upgrades + ultimates)
- `neutronSpeed`: 1.0 → up to 2.5x (10 levels × 10% + 50% ultimate)
- `neutronLifetime`: 1.0 → up to 3.0x (10 levels × 20%)
- `neutronSize`: 1.0 → up to 1.75x (5 levels × 15%)
- `pierce`: 0% → up to 25% (5 levels × 5%)
- `homing`: 0 → 5 (5 levels)

#### Atom Upgrades (7 nodes)
- `atomSpawnRate`: 1.0 → up to 2.5x (10 levels × 10% + 50% ultimate)
- `atomSize`: 1.0 → up to 1.75x (5 levels × 15%)
- `atomLifetime`: 1.0 → up to 2.25x (5 levels × 25%)
- `neutronCountAtom`: 2 → up to 7 (+3 from upgrades + 2 ultimate)

#### Chain Upgrades (5 nodes)
- `chainMultiplier`: 1.0 → up to 5.0x (15 levels × 0.2 + 1.0 ultimate)
- `momentum`: 0 → 1 (enabled, clicks don't reset chain)
- `neutronReflector`: 0% → up to 50% (5 levels × 10%)

#### Resource Upgrades (8 nodes)
- `maxClicks`: 2 → up to 8 (+4 from upgrades + 2 ultimate)
- `maxTime`: 10s → up to 23s (+8s from upgrades + 5s ultimate)

## 🎮 How to Test

### In-Game Testing:
1. **Start the game**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Play a round**: Click "Play" to earn coins
3. **Access Skill Tree**: Go to "Skill Tree" page
4. **Purchase upgrades**: Click on unlocked nodes to buy
5. **Observe effects**: 
   - Neutron count increases when clicking
   - Speed/lifetime/size changes visible
   - Chain multipliers affect coin earnings
   - Resource upgrades give more clicks/time

### Console Testing:
```javascript
// Check current game state
gameState.getState().upgrades

// Check skill tree
skillTreeManager.getAllSkills()

// Check a specific skill
skillTreeManager.getSkill('neutron_count_1')

// Manually test purchase (after loading)
skillTreeManager.upgradeSkill('neutron_count_1')
```

## 📊 Progression Example

### Early Game (First 500 coins):
```
Root (0 coins) → Unlocks all paths
↓
Neutron Path (10 coins) → Neutron upgrades available
↓
Extra Neutron I (50 coins) → 2→3 neutrons per click
↓
Extended Time I (100 coins) → 10→12 seconds
↓
Neutron Velocity I (100 coins → 905 total for max) → 1.0→1.5x speed
```

### Mid Game (500-3000 coins):
```
Chain Bonus I (100 coins → 400 total for max) → 1.0→2.0x multiplier
Chain Bonus II (500 coins → 2000 total for max) → 2.0→3.0x multiplier
Chain Reaction I (400 coins) → Atoms drop 3 neutrons instead of 2
Extra Neutron II (200 coins) → 3→4 neutrons per click
```

### Late Game (3000+ coins):
```
Chain Momentum (2500 coins) → Clicks don't reset chain counter
Extra Neutron III (800 coins) → 4→5 neutrons per click
Chain Bonus III (2000 coins → 8000 total for max) → 3.0→4.0x multiplier
Ultimate Neutron Mastery (10,000 coins) → +2 neutrons, +50% speed
Ultimate Chain Mastery (15,000 coins) → +1.0x multiplier, permanent momentum
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure:
```
assets/data/
  └── skilltree.json          # All upgrade definitions

src/systems/
  ├── SkillTreeManager.ts     # Core skill tree logic
  └── GameStateManager.ts     # Game state with upgrade values

src/pages/
  └── SkillTreePage.ts        # Visual interface (uses SkillTreeManager)
```

### Key Classes:

#### `SkillTreeManager`
```typescript
- loadSkillTree(): Load from JSON
- upgradeSkill(id): Purchase and apply effects
- getSkillCost(skill): Calculate current cost
- unlockChildren(id): Unlock connected nodes
- applySkillEffect(skill): Modify game state
- resetSkillTree(): Reset for fresh run
```

#### `GameState.upgrades`
```typescript
interface GameState {
  upgrades: {
    // Neutron stats
    neutronSpeed: number;
    neutronLifetime: number;
    neutronSize: number;
    neutronCountPlayer: number;
    neutronCountAtom: number;
    
    // Atom stats
    atomSpeed: number;
    atomLifetime: number;
    atomSize: number;
    atomSpawnRate: number;
    atomHealth: number;
    
    // Special abilities
    neutronReflector: number;
    pierce: number;
    homing: number;
    momentum: number;
    chainMultiplier: number;
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Effect Examples

### Neutron Count Upgrade:
```typescript
// Before: 2 neutrons per click
gameState.getState().upgrades.neutronCountPlayer = 2;

// After purchasing "Extra Neutron I":
skillTreeManager.upgradeSkill('neutron_count_1');
gameState.getState().upgrades.neutronCountPlayer = 3; // +1

// After purchasing all 3 neutron count upgrades:
// neutronCountPlayer = 5 (2 base + 3 upgrades)

// After ultimate:
// neutronCountPlayer = 7 (5 + 2 from ultimate)
```

### Chain Multiplier Upgrade:
```typescript
// Before: 1.0x chain multiplier
gameState.getState().upgrades.chainMultiplier = 1.0;

// After purchasing Chain Bonus I (level 5):
skillTreeManager.upgradeSkill('chain_multiplier_1'); // x5
// chainMultiplier = 2.0 (1.0 + 5×0.2)

// After purchasing all 3 tiers (15 levels):
// chainMultiplier = 4.0 (1.0 + 15×0.2)

// After ultimate:
// chainMultiplier = 5.0 (4.0 + 1.0 from ultimate)
```

### Momentum Upgrade:
```typescript
// Before: Clicking resets chain to 0
gameState.getState().upgrades.momentum = 0;

// After purchasing "Chain Momentum":
skillTreeManager.upgradeSkill('momentum');
gameState.getState().upgrades.momentum = 1;

// Result: In GameStateManager.useClick(), chain no longer resets
// Player can click multiple times while maintaining chain bonus
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

To fully integrate with gameplay:

1. **ReactionVisualizer Integration**:
   - Use `state.upgrades.neutronSpeed` for neutron velocity
   - Use `state.upgrades.neutronSize` for neutron radius
   - Use `state.upgrades.atomSpawnRate` for spawn frequency

2. **Physics Integration**:
   - Apply `state.upgrades.pierce` as collision pass-through chance
   - Apply `state.upgrades.homing` as target tracking strength
   - Apply `state.upgrades.neutronReflector` as wall bounce chance

3. **UI Updates**:
   - Show active upgrade effects in game HUD
   - Display skill tree preview in home screen
   - Add upgrade recommendations

4. **Balance Testing**:
   - Verify progression feels rewarding
   - Adjust costs if upgrades are too cheap/expensive
   - Test ultimate unlocks at appropriate power level
