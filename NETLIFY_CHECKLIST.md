- `dist/` - Build output (generated)
- `public/` - Static assets
- `.nvmrc` - Node version

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify Node version matches
3. Test build locally: `npm run build`
4. Check for missing dependencies

### 404 Errors
1. Verify redirects in `netlify.toml`
2. Check `public/_redirects` exists
3. Ensure build completed successfully
4. Clear cache and redeploy

### Assets Not Loading
1. Check file paths (use relative paths)
2. Verify files in `public/` or imported
3. Check browser console
4. Verify dist/ structure

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Site is accessible via Netlify URL
